2EMIdQexXbYojbrGTKGMOa,Space Policy,"The increasing commercialization and militarization of space has led to a new geopolitical reality beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Civil space agencies like the National Aeronautics and Science Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) have historically served as instrumental hubs for space exploration and innovation. At the same time, U.S.-based commercial company SpaceX has transformed the launch industry and contributed to the congestion of Low Earth Orbit, which has more than ten times the number of satellites than a decade ago. In 2022, the European Union released its first-ever space strategy, centered on security and defense. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, have released their own defense strategies for outer space and have also ramped up domestic production and procurement of military satellites. Nonetheless, the majority of transatlantic countries agree that democratic values must remain the center of civil space exploration, which is reflected in the U.S.-led Artemis Accords and growing ESA membership. Canada is in a unique position, as both an Artemis signatory and special cooperative status holder within ESA.

In 2023, EUSPA’s budget was €1.5 ($1.62) billion, all of which came from the European Commission. In 2022, the EU published its first Space Strategy for Security and Defence, which outlines the bloc’s counterspace capabilities—the capacity to deny, disrupt, degrade or destroy space systems—and main vulnerabilities in space, including cyberattacks on space systems. The strategy calls for an increase in space exercises with partners and allies to improve responses to these threats. The European Space Agency (ESA), founded in 1975 as an intergovernmental organization, is the driving force behind most European space activities. Although ESA works closely with the European Union, it is not an EU agency, thereby allowing membership of non-EU countries such as Canada and the UK.

With the Department of State, NASA co-leads the Artemis Accords, a set of nonbinding principles for space exploration and activities. The accords are related to NASA’s Artemis Program, which aims to put humans back on the Moon by 2027, one year before construction of the Russian and Chinese International Lunar Research Station is scheduled to begin. As of May 2023, the U.S. was the sole operator of 5165 satellites in orbit, 3950 of which belong to SpaceX, the U.S.-based spacecraft and rocket manufacturer owned by Elon Musk. The most recent overview of U.S. space policy was released in 2020. It has several objectives, including the expansion of American leadership in space by establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon. In 2019, President Donald Trump established the U.S. Space Force as an independent branch of the military. Pituffik Space Base in Greenland is the force’s northernmost installation. It plays a key role in missile defense and satellite communication capabilities, which are considered instrumental for American superiority in space.

Fully 16,567 have been assessed for combat readiness, and 10,458 are considered ready. The U.S. operates 7,076 fixed-wing aircraft. Fully 3,203 have been assessed for combat readiness, and 1,720 are considered ready, including 867 fifth-generation fighters. The U.S. has a sizeable navy with 122 principal surface combatants, 75 of which are combat ready, and 65 submarines, 25 of which are combat ready. In 2022, the U.S. published its first unclassified version of its National Defense Strategy as part of an effort to increase military transparency. In 2024, the U.S. released its first-ever National Defense Industrial Strategy, which was designed to guide defense policy and investment for five years. Since taking office for the second time, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders for an “Iron Dome”, an advanced air defense system, and for prioritizing military “excellence and readiness”. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the U.S. has increased defense spending by 0.02% of GDP and provided $128.02 billion, or 0.55% of GDP, in total bilateral commitments to Kyiv. This includes high-quality military equipment. In March 2025, Trump paused U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine; both were reinstated later that month.

The European Union will be holding elections for its Parliament from June 6-9, the United States will vote for president on November 5, and there is a possibility for early elections in both Canada and the United Kingdom. While the political dynamics and campaign issues in each country vary, transatlantic voters are connected in the common global challenges they face: support for Ukraine, relations with China, rising populism and democratic backsliding. In the European Union, top issues include the fight against poverty and social exclusion, public health, and stimulating the economy through job creation. In the United States, voters are most concerned with the fight against terrorism, migration, and reducing crime. Critical will be engagement with youth voters, as politicians seek to connect with young people on the issues that matter most to them, to ensure the next generation of active and informed citizens.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) governs FDI in the U.S., the UK’s National Security and Investment Act was passed in 2021, the Investment Canada Act has been in effect for decades, and the European Union passed in 2019 its FDI Act, with the goal of all 27 member states having their own coordinated investment screening mechanisms. Foreign direct investment can be measured in a number of ways; for this indicator, FDI flows reflect the net value of all investments into a business or enterprise in the receiving country by a foreign investor, minus the withdrawal of any portion of the original investments by the investor for any reason.

Between 2016-2022, 86 AI-related bills have been passed in Barometer countries. Venture capital investment in artificial intelligence also continues to increase, creating a nexus of both innovation and regulation. In the spirit of the topic, the below summary on transatlantic artificial intelligence was written by Chat GPT:\n\nTransatlantic artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration signifies a cooperative venture between North American and European nations to propel the development of AI technology. This initiative spans research, policy, and ethical considerations to create a harmonized approach. By leveraging shared expertise and resources, these regions strive to advance innovation while ensuring responsible AI deployment. The collaboration emphasizes the importance of addressing common challenges, including privacy, security, and biases, through joint research efforts and the establishment of ethical guidelines. Furthermore, the Transatlantic AI community aims to create cohesive regulatory frameworks that promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. Through knowledge exchange, research partnerships, and policy alignment, this collaborative effort seeks to shape a global AI landscape that prioritizes ethical standards, safeguards societal interests, and fosters international cooperation in the realm of artificial intelligence.\n",m55kDO5O2gW9876Bl2KIC,barChart,2023 Estimates of Venture Capital Investment in AI (in millions USD),2023-estimates-of-venture-capital-investment-in-ai-in-millions-usd,"OECD 2023 Estimate of Venture Capital Investments in AI (Malta 2021, Luxembourg 2022)",us,67911,de,16087,ca,15172,fr,11595,eu,8207,gb,3518,se,2603,at,1574,nl,1466,pt,1300,be,1205,it,1153,ie,1063,dk,976,fi,749,ee,437,ro,360,pl,304,es,254,cz,205,hu,204,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,,,3qVHpg3hWQE5mIxgxNLzrV,customInfographic,AI-Related Bills 2016-2022,ai-related-bills-2016-2022,Number of AI-Related bills passed between 2016-2022,//assets.ctfassets.net/lzfj1nv0bx75/3ZaVoStf6cIpoz30byJ43d/368e6379427e5605e63029a6a92a2ff9/BFNA_Regulating_AI_010623.pdf,"AI-Related Bills 2016-2022 ",38pZMVVUpq6zkPB1fspmyn,timelineChart,Date of First AI Strategy,date-of-first-ai-strategy,,,fi,2017-01-14,ca,2017-01-21,fr,2018-01-07,de,2018-01-07,se,2018-01-14,lu,2019-01-06,nl,2019-01-06,cy,2019-01-11,dk,2019-01-11,lt,2019-01-11,cz,2019-01-12,mt,2019-01-13,hu,2020-01-05,pl,2020-01-05,it,2020-01-10,bg,2020-01-11,pt,2020-01-12,si,2020-01-12,es,2020-01-12,at,2021-01-16,ie,2021-01-16,gb,2021-01-17,ee,2022-01-13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,true,,true,true,,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,,true,true,true,,true,true,true,true,true,true,,,true,true,true,true,,,,5AnU9RnVnvIAesVBaoLZ0C,european-union,2mB5esqNixZztOShNZiAqw,eu,"The European Union (EU) is in the process of ratifying its AI Act, which, if passed, will create binding obligations for all member states.

In December 2023, a provisional agreement was reached. The act uses a risk categorization system based on the level of risk certain applications pose to the safety, health, and rights of individuals. The first is unacceptable risk, which includes AI systems considered a threat, such as biometric identification systems including facial recognition. The second is high risk, which includes AI systems that negatively affect safety or fundamental rights, such as using AI to assist in legal interpretations. The third is generative AI, including Chat GPT, which must comply with transparency requirements.

A NATO release from April 2023 states that hybrid warfare, the combination of attacks by military and non-military cyberattacks, poses a significant challenge to the overall security of the alliance. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many Barometer countries have experienced an increase in cyberattacks, in some instances openly acknowledged by Russian hacking groups as retaliation for support of Ukraine. All Transatlantic Barometer actors have National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) that differ in their goals and implementation, but are united in seeking to create more technologically resilient governments and societies better able to prevent and withstand cyber crises. The European Union also has a Cyber Security Strategy, comprised of legal obligations for its member states through its Network and Information Security 2 Directive, and a roadmap for increased cyber competency across the bloc. Seven Barometer countries (U.S., UK, Estonia, Spain, Lithuania, Canada, and France) are ranked in the top 10 of the United Nations’ Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), demonstrating that cybersecurity is both a priority and a strategic competency for transatlantic actors.

This means that more women in government is not just beneficial to women, but to all constituents. To increase the number of female parliamentarians and ministers, a number of European countries have established mandatory gender quotas for party candidate lists and/or representative bodies, and many political parties have implemented additional voluntary quotas within their own party ranks. Gender mainstreaming, or the practice of integrating a gender equality perspective at all levels of policy and programming, has become a pillar of transatlantic gender policy both domestically and abroad, as evidenced by the “feminist foreign policy” strategies of France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada.

6PhwALeY6CuG1GF8aCv9cb,Broadband and Digital Connectivity,"Access to high-speed broadband is a policy priority for transatlantic actors. The European Union boasts a Digital Decade program, the United States has a Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, and the United Kingdom maintains its Project Gigabit. All three efforts focus on increasing broadband access and overall digital connectivity for residents. \nDigital connectivity topped the agenda at the December 2022 U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting. Increased digital connectivity expands economic and educational opportunities for those hindered by geography, socioeconomic status, or disability. High-speed broadband access is essential for navigating an increasingly digital world, especially one in which remote work and online education are growing more prevalent.\nNot all broadband is created equal, however. Next generation access (NGA), or broadband that operates at speeds of at least 30 megabits per second (Mbps), is considered the entry point to high-speed internet. The EU aims for internet access with a speed of 1000 Mbps, or 1 gigabit per second (Gbps), for all its residents by 2030. Although this gigabit internet is much faster than that currently in most households, the potential economic and educational advancement that comes with high-speed broadband has spurred the EU to think ahead. Gigabit internet operates through very high capacity networks (VHCNs) and relies on an infrastructure largely comprised of fiber optic cables and, to a lesser extent, coaxial cables. Both are lighter, stronger, and more stable than traditional copper cables. Continuing investment in VHCN infrastructure, driven by fiber optic cable deployment, will shape the future of transatlantic digital connectivity.",4D8nIKX4t7cE6SHkQrg3gp,barChart,Next Generation Access Coverage,next-generation-access-coverage,,cy,100,mt,100,lu,99.4,be,99,nl,99,dk,98,gb,98,hu,97,it,97,de,96,ie,96,es,96,lv,94,ca,93.5,at,93,bg,93,cz,93,ro,93,gr,92,pt,91,ee,90,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7tt7eU2eOpYWVYO7DVcu8I,european-union,6PhwALeY6CuG1GF8aCv9cb,eu,"Based on the average of its 27 member states, 78% of EU households have fixed broadband subscriptions.

EU-wide very high capacity network (VHCN) coverage stands at 70%, a sharp uptick from 19.5% coverage in 2014. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) coverage is at 50%, double the level in 2016. Expanding access to high-speed internet infrastructure is critical to achieving the goals of the EU’s Digital Decade, a wide-ranging policy program meant to transform by 2030 the bloc’s digital capacity for skills training, infrastructure, online public services, and business transformation. The EU specifically aims to achieve universal gigabit internet coverage by 2030, but the biggest impediment to this is the urban-rural digital divide, especially in high-speed infrastructure, across the bloc. While overall VHCN coverage is 70%, it is just 37% in rural areas; overall FTTP coverage is 50%, but 33.7% in rural areas. The DESI report has identified three major goals for closing the digital divide: creating a predictable regulatory environment, providing incentives for private investment in underserviced areas, and prioritizing mechanisms to minimize deployment costs. To achieve these aims, the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility will allocate more than €16 billion in funding for digital connectivity initiatives.

In February 2021, the United States formally rejoined the Paris Agreement after withdrawing from the accords in 2017. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which targets a 40% emissions decrease compared to 2005 levels by 2030, as well as investments in renewable energy technology. The UK enacted the Climate Change Act in 2008, which aims to reduce greenhouse emissions by 100% of 1990 levels by 2050. Following the Conference of Parties (COP) 27 in November 2022, the transatlantic community, along with other major global emitters, signed an agreement to compensate developing countries for climate loss and damage, although the text did not include commitments to reducing fossil fuel usage.

Greenhouse gas emissions per capita were 10.7 thousand kilograms in 2004, 9.3 in 2012, and 7.5 in 2020, accounting for stable population growth. Historically, hydropower has long been the main source of renewable energy for the EU, but wind power has recently surpassed it. In addition to wind, solar power generation has also been growing, a reflection of member state initiatives to increase production in these sectors. The European Union has introduced a number of legislative initiatives to curb climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through its European Green Deal, the EU pursues its goal of making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050. The European Climate Law sets a binding target of 55% emissions reduction (compared to 1990 levels) across the bloc by 2030, requiring member states to submit National Energy and Climate Plans to create national frameworks to achieve EU goals. The EU’s Emissions Trading System, a cornerstone of its emissions reduction policies, created a “cap-and-trade” system, which sets an upper limit on the amount of emissions industries can produce, while allowing emitters to buy additional capacity from lower-producing companies that have not hit their limits. This system has set the stage for the EU to meet collective targets as a whole even as it accommodates member states’ unique national needs.

Freedom of expression, media freedom, and media pluralism are all protected under the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Parliament (EP) has taken its own measures in recent years to promote media freedom in the EU and beyond. The EP called in November 2021 for new rules to protect journalists from censorship and, in March 2022, a special parliamentary committee adopted a report that urged European authorities to support independent media and devise a common strategy to counter foreign influence and disinformation. In May 2022, the EP also established a scholarship for young journalists. The award bears the name of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered in 2017 for her work.
