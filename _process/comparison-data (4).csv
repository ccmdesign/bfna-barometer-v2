Space Policy,"The increasing commercialization and militarization of space has led to a new geopolitical reality beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Civil space agencies like the National Aeronautics and Science Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) have historically served as instrumental hubs for space exploration and innovation. At the same time, U.S.-based commercial company SpaceX has transformed the launch industry and contributed to the congestion of Low Earth Orbit, which has more than ten times the number of satellites than a decade ago. In 2022, the European Union released its first-ever space strategy, centered on security and defense. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, have released their own defense strategies for outer space and have also ramped up domestic production and procurement of military satellites. Nonetheless, the majority of transatlantic countries agree that democratic values must remain the center of civil space exploration, which is reflected in the U.S.-led Artemis Accords and growing ESA membership. Canada is in a unique position, as both an Artemis signatory and special cooperative status holder within ESA. As space moves away from a domain committed primarily to science and civil cooperation and becomes a proxy for security and commercial conflicts on Earth, tensions are rising in the final frontier.","The European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) was established in 2004 to manage the bloc’s space-based services. These include Galileo, which provides the most accurate positioning, navigation, and timing services worldwide; the EU Governmental Satellite Communications program, which provides secure communications services to member state governments; and Copernicus, which collects Earth observation data. In 2023, EUSPA’s budget was €1.5 ($1.62) billion, all of which came from the European Commission. In 2022, the EU published its first Space Strategy for Security and Defence, which outlines the bloc’s counterspace capabilities—the capacity to deny, disrupt, degrade or destroy space systems—and main vulnerabilities in space, including cyberattacks on space systems. The strategy calls for an increase in space exercises with partners and allies to improve responses to these threats. The European Space Agency (ESA), founded in 1975 as an intergovernmental organization, is the driving force behind most European space activities. Although ESA works closely with the European Union, it is not an EU agency, thereby allowing membership of non-EU countries such as Canada and the UK. In 2024, ESA’s total budget was €7.88 ($8.56) billion, most of which came from member state contributions. On average, ESA members contributed €189.5 ($205.8) million in 2024.",About ESA,https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Corporate_news/ESA_facts,ESA Budget 2024,https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2024/01/ESA_budget_2024,About EUSPA,https://www.euspa.europa.eu/about/about-euspa,Annual Accounts of EUSPA,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/286346/EUSPA Final Annual Accounts 2023.pdf,EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-space/eu-space-strategy-security-and-defence_en,Galileo Satellite Navigation,https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-space/galileo-satellite-navigation_en,"The United States established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958, shortly after the Soviet Union launched the world’s first satellite into orbit. NASA had a budget of $27.2 billion in 2024, a 7.1% increase over the previous year. However, an April 2025 draft budget proposal for the agency reflected a 20% cut in funding. With the Department of State, NASA co-leads the Artemis Accords, a set of nonbinding principles for space exploration and activities. The accords are related to NASA’s Artemis Program, which aims to put humans back on the Moon by 2027, one year before construction of the Russian and Chinese International Lunar Research Station is scheduled to begin. As of May 2023, the U.S. was the sole operator of 5165 satellites in orbit, 3950 of which belong to SpaceX, the U.S.-based spacecraft and rocket manufacturer owned by Elon Musk. The most recent overview of U.S. space policy was released in 2020. It has several objectives, including the expansion of American leadership in space by establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon. In 2019, President Donald Trump established the U.S. Space Force as an independent branch of the military. Pituffik Space Base in Greenland is the force’s northernmost installation. It plays a key role in missile defense and satellite communication capabilities, which are considered instrumental for American superiority in space.

Democracy,"The transatlantic alliance is built on a foundation of shared democratic values. In recent years, transatlantic partners have experienced both democratic backsliding and increased democratization. Hungarian democracy has eroded to such an extent that the European Parliament declared in 2022 that it is no longer a “full democracy”. At the same time, Poland’s new government has committed to strengthening democratic institutions after years of backsliding under the former PiS-led government, showing a potential path forward for other transatlantic partners facing democratic decline.\nThis indicator focuses on three key aspects of democratic health: electoral fairness, press freedom, and judicial independence. These measures are supplemented by assessments of the state of democracy in each Barometer country, sourced from the Regimes of the World dataset included in the Varieties of Democracy Institute’s yearly reports. One challenge in measuring an ever-evolving topic such as democracy is the lag between reported data and changes in government administration or policies. Some datasets used in this indicator are updated through 2023 or 2024, meaning more recent events may not be fully reflected in their scores. However, in combination with cited news articles, these datasets provide a clear snapshot of the state of democracy in each Barometer country.","The European Union and its member states are committed to the principles of “human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights,” spelled out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, a founding document of the Union. EU members can be sanctioned by the governing European Commission for noncompliance with these principles. However, national judiciaries, press regulations, and both national and European Parliament elections are administered domestically. The various democracy indicators do not evaluate the EU itself, but the average of EU member states’ scores on the Varieties of Democracy Institute’s Electoral Democracy Index was 0.80/1.00 in 2024, down from 0.82 in 2018 and even with the Barometer average. On the World Press Freedom Index, the EU member nations as a group averaged 76.26/100 in 2025, a drop from the 2018 score of 80.23 and slightly above the Barometer average of 76.07. The average Global State of Democracy Judiciary Independence score for the EU overall was 0.74/1.00 in 2023, the same as its 2018 average and the Barometer average. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe characterized the 2024 European Parliament (EP) elections as “genuinely competitive and professionally organized,” but highlighted the lack of uniformity in electoral laws across member states as well as a lack of coverage of EP campaigning by national media, with domestic issues typically dominating EU-level politics.",V-Dem Democracy Report 2025,https://www.v-dem.net/documents/60/V-dem-dr__2025_lowres.pdf,V-Dem Datasets 2025,https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/,V-Dem Datasets Archive,https://v-dem.net/data/dataset-archive/,World Press Freedom Index 2025,https://rsf.org/en/index,Global State of Democracy Indices,https://www.idea.int/democracytracker/gsod-indices,OSCE Report European Parliament Elections 2024,https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/581764,"The United States is classified as a liberal democracy in the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Institute’s 2025 Democracy Report. This means that elections are free and fair, there are constraints on the executive, and civil liberties are protected. The U.S., along with the UK and Portugal, occupies 14th place among the 30 Transatlantic Barometer countries on V-Dem’s Liberal Democracy Index. In 2024, the U.S. scored 0.84/1.00 on V-Dem’s Electoral Democracy Index, above the Barometer average of 0.80 and up from 0.82 in 2018. On the World Press Freedom Index, the U.S. scored 65.49/100 in 2025, a sharp drop from its 2018 score of 76.27 and well below the Barometer average of 76.07.

Actions or decisions made under the current Trump Administration have not yet been reflected in the above datasets. As of February 2025, the GSoD Democracy Tracker flagged President Donald Trump’s unilateral freezes of federal funding as damaging to the rule of law.

Security and Defense,"After over 75 years of peace, Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has brought war back to the European continent. This has prompted a shift in transatlantic defense considerations at the NATO, EU, and national level. Germany's creation of a 100 billion Euro special fund to revitalize its military was one of the most prominent defense spending increases, but it has not acted alone. Of NATO's 32 members, 23 met or exceeded the alliance’s defense spending target of 2% of GDP in 2024, in contrast to just six members in 2021. In March 2025, the European Union published a white paper outlining its “ReArm Europe” plan, which would generate 800 billion Euros for defense investment over the next four years. As Europe seeks to deepen its commitment to defense, the United States is showing signs of pulling back from NATO and transatlantic security cooperation. Support for Ukraine continues to be a bellwether of Barometer countries’ willingness to invest and engage on collective defense.","In 2023, European Union institutions spent $923.6 million, or 0.01% of GDP, on defense. According the SIPRI Military Expenditure database, the EU ranks 80th globally in military spending in absolute terms. On average, EU member states individually spent $10.62 billion on defense in 2023. Established in 2004, the European Defence Agency is an intergovernmental body that promotes defense collaboration within the bloc. It supports the development of defense capabilities by, in part, funding research and technology. It also acts as a military liaison for EU policies. The agency does not possess military equipment but offers joint training exercises to member-state militaries. In 2022, the EU approved its Strategic Compass, an ambitious plan to strengthen the group’s security and defense policy by 2030. Increased intra-EU production, trade and procurement of materiel is its main objective. In 2024, the EU established the European Defence Industrial Programme (EDIP) in coordination with the European Defence Agency with a budget of €1.5 billion ($1.62 billion). The Strategic Compass and EDIP were developed in response to Europe’s changing security environment following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

According to the SIPRI Military Expenditure database, the U.S. ranks first globally in military spending in absolute terms and 21st in military spending as a percentage of GDP. The U.S. armed forces’ personnel consist of 1,315,600 active members and 797,200 reserve members. The U.S. has 50,961 armored fighting vehicles. Fully 16,567 have been assessed for combat readiness, and 10,458 are considered ready. The U.S. operates 7,076 fixed-wing aircraft. Fully 3,203 have been assessed for combat readiness, and 1,720 are considered ready, including 867 fifth-generation fighters. The U.S. has a sizeable navy with 122 principal surface combatants, 75 of which are combat ready, and 65 submarines, 25 of which are combat ready. In 2022, the U.S. published its first unclassified version of its National Defense Strategy as part of an effort to increase military transparency. In 2024, the U.S. released its first-ever National Defense Industrial Strategy, which was designed to guide defense policy and investment for five years. Since taking office for the second time, President Donald Trump has issued executive orders for an “Iron Dome”, an advanced air defense system, and for prioritizing military “excellence and readiness”. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the U.S. has increased defense spending by 0.02% of GDP and provided $128.02 billion, or 0.55% of GDP, in total bilateral commitments to Kyiv. This includes high-quality military equipment. In March 2025, Trump paused U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine; both were reinstated later that month.

Elections and Voter Turnout,"2024 is considered a “super election year”, with more than 4 billion people eligible to cast a vote worldwide. The European Union will be holding elections for its Parliament from June 6-9, the United States will vote for president on November 5, and there is a possibility for early elections in both Canada and the United Kingdom. While the political dynamics and campaign issues in each country vary, transatlantic voters are connected in the common global challenges they face: support for Ukraine, relations with China, rising populism and democratic backsliding. In the European Union, top issues include the fight against poverty and social exclusion, public health, and stimulating the economy through job creation. In the United States, voters are most concerned with the fight against terrorism, migration, and reducing crime. Critical will be engagement with youth voters, as politicians seek to connect with young people on the issues that matter most to them, to ensure the next generation of active and informed citizens. ","Voter turnout in the European Union’s last three European Parliament (EP) elections was 42.61% in 2014, 50.66% in 2019, and 50.74% in 2024. The next EP election will be held by June 10, 2029, the second one since the United Kingdom’s formal exit from the EU in 2020. The minimum voting age in the bloc ranges from 16 to 18, depending on the member state. Voting is compulsory in Belgium, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Greece. Voting from outside the EU is not possible for Czech, Irish, Maltese and Slovak citizens. Ahead of the 2024 vote, the EP created together.eu, an online platform that enables EU citizens to share ideas and promote debate on election-related topics. The platform has e-learning modules and ready-to-print materials offering information intended to educate young people about the importance of democratic engagement through voting. A 2024 Eurobarometer public opinion survey polled EU citizens on what made them vote. Fully 42% said the rising prices, cost of living was their number one issue, while 41% cited the economic situation.

E-Governance,"Advancements in e-governance can streamline government bureaucracy and make access to citizen services easier than ever before. The digitalization of the public sector allows for faster processing, greater access for citizens with disabilities, and encourages government innovation. Transatlantic countries perform well on global e-governance indicators, such as the United Nations E-Governance Development Index, which measures telecommunications infrastructure, online services, and human capital. The United States passed its E-Government Act in 2002; Canada created the Deputy Ministers’ Committee on Digital and Data to oversee its e-governance transition, all 24 UK ministries were moved online by 2013; and the European Union has entrenched e-governance benchmarks into its Digital Decade program. Challenges to e-governance remain, primarily in closing the digital divide and ensuring that elderly or less tech-savvy citizens are not left behind. However, digital literacy campaigns and online government help services have made significant strides in getting more citizens engaged and online.\n","All European Union member states rank in the top 60 of the 193 countries in the United Nations’ E-Government Development Index (EGDI), which is based on measures related to telecommunications infrastructure, online services, and human capital. In 2021, the EU launched its Digital Decade policy program, which is meant to spur digital transformation across the bloc in four areas: digital skills, digital infrastructure, digital transformation of businesses, and digitalization of public services. The target for e-governance, which falls under digitalization of public services, includes having all important public services online by 2030. By 2023, the EU attained 77% of this goal. The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), which considers accessibility of digital public services, reveals that, on average, 65% of EU citizens accessed e-government services in 2022. Work has also been underway to increase cross-border digitalization across the bloc. The Interoperable Europe Act came into force in 2024 and is intended to coordinate the EU’s digital transformation of public services by facilitating cross-border data exchange. The 2014 eIDAS Regulation specified common criteria for digitalization to ensure bloc-wide recognition and interoperability of digital ID plans. As part of this regulation, member states are obligated to notify the European Commission of any new national digital ID plans. As of 2023, 21 of the 27 EU member states offered at least one type of digital ID.",Information on Interoperable Europe Act,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/03/04/interoperable-europe-act-council-adopts-new-law-for-more-efficient-digital-public-services-across-the-eu/,EIDAS Regulation,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation,2023 Report on the state of the Digital Decade,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/2023-report-state-digital-decade,,,,,,,"The United States ranks 10th out of 193 countries on the United Nations’ E-Government Development Index (EGDI), which is based on measures related to telecommunications infrastructure, online services, and human capital.

However, the relatively high level of telecommunications and human capital development in the U.S. contribute to its high EGDI ranking. The E-Government Act, passed in 2002, created a structure for federal agencies to better deliver online services to citizens. This included the establishment of the Office of E-Government and the role of a federal chief information officer within the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Foreign Direct Investment,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an economic endeavor between two countries that often carries political significance. Countries can strengthen ties through investment and joint ventures, or FDI can be seen as a way for actors to exert undue influence in another country and gain access to critical domestic sectors. Increasingly, transatlantic countries have been seeking to find a balance between being open for investment while protecting sensitive industries. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) governs FDI in the U.S., the UK’s National Security and Investment Act was passed in 2021, the Investment Canada Act has been in effect for decades, and the European Union passed in 2019 its FDI Act, with the goal of all 27 member states having their own coordinated investment screening mechanisms. Foreign direct investment can be measured in a number of ways; for this indicator, FDI flows reflect the net value of all investments into a business or enterprise in the receiving country by a foreign investor, minus the withdrawal of any portion of the original investments by the investor for any reason. In some instances, this can create a negative FDI flow, where the total amount of the investments withdrawn in a given period is greater than the amount of investment going into the country.","In 2022, the European Union’s inward foreign direct investment (FDI) was -€80.7 billion (-$84.8 billion), and its outward FDI was €161 billion ($170 billion). FDI flows reflect the net value of all investments into a business or enterprise in the receiving country by a foreign investor, minus the withdrawal of any portion of the original investments by the investor for any reason. Negative flows generally indicate that the value of divestment, or withdrawal of equity, was larger than the total sum of investment into the bloc during this period. The top sources of FDI in all EU member states, as an aggregate, were the United States, Germany and France. This investment was primarily in information and communications technology (ICT) and manufacturing. The top destinations for FDI from all EU member states, as an aggregate, were the United States, Japan and Germany. The top sector for this investment was electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply. The EU’s FDI Regulation, which was passed in 2019 and went into effect on October 11, 2020, aims to allow the bloc to identify, assess, and mitigate risks of certain foreign investments while remaining an attractive investment location. Under the framework, a member state must provide, upon request from the European Commission or another member state, information on an inward investment and notify the Commission of any case flagged for national screening. Member states remain responsible for implementing their own national screening mechanisms and have the final say on screening decisions. As of July 2024, only three EU member states—Croatia, Cyprus and Greece—lacked a national screening mechanism. In 2022, member states handled 1,444 requests for FDI authorization, 55% of which were formally screened. Of these, 86% were authorized without any conditions attached. Only 1% were blocked.",UNCTAD,https://unctad.org/topic/investment/investment-statistics-and-trends,OECD,https://data-explorer.oecd.org/,EuroStat,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Foreign_direct_investment_-_flows,European Commission,https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/be8b568f-73f3-409c-b4a4-30acfcec5283/library/5975e8f0-7679-47a2-9770-a49aedd5cef9/details,Daldewolf,https://www.daldewolf.com/update-on-the-screening-of-fdi-into-the-european-union/,,,"In 2022, the United States’ inward foreign direct investment (FDI) was €316.1 billion ($332.4 billion), and its outward FDI was €348.4 billion ($336.4 billion). FDI flows reflect the net value of all investments into a business or enterprise in the receiving country by a foreign investor, minus the withdrawal of any portion of the original investments by the investor for any reason. The top sources of FDI in the U.S. were the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands, with investment primarily in manufacturing, finance and insurance, and wholesale trade. The top destinations for American FDI were the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Canada. Aside from holding companies, the top sectors for this investment were manufacturing, finance and insurance. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency committee chaired by the Department of Treasury, conducts FDI reviews in the U.S. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) of 2018 stipulated an updated screening mechanism, resulting in an increase in cases reviewed. Screening applies to investments in American businesses involved in critical technologies, critical infrastructure or sensitive personal data (TID). Filing is mandatory for investments in which a foreign government would acquire at least 49% of the voting shares in an entity, or when the investment involves the acquisition of at least 25% of the voting shares in a TID business. Review is also mandatory for a foreign investment in a TID business related to critical technologies. CFIUS reviewed 440 cases in 2022, 23% of which were approved subject to conditions.

Migration,"Migration has become a central theme for transatlantic actors, as global conflict has dominated the transatlantic sphere. For Europe, Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has brought millions of Ukrainians to its borders, in addition to ongoing migratory waves from the Middle East. In the United States and Canada, managing migration from the south continues to be a challenge. From January to June 2023, nearly 3.5 million asylum seekers were reported to Transatlantic Barometer countries, spanning a wide geographical, cultural, professional, and religious range. Barometer countries have taken different approaches to refugee integration, with some opting for faster entry into the labor market and less social assistance, and some waiting longer to grant work permits but providing social support. Integration efforts are varied, with a majority of Barometer countries offering some form of language instruction and cultural integration courses. Large-scale migration comes with both challenges and opportunities for Barometer countries, as they seek to uphold safe, effective, and humanitarian asylum practices while balancing national capabilities.","UNHCR reported 896,293 asylum seekers in the EU’s 27 member states from January to June 2023. Ukrainians need not apply for asylum in the bloc under its Temporary Protection Directive. In 2023, the EU passed a New Pact on Asylum and Migration, a commitment by all member states to ensure a fairer, efficient and more sustainable European migration policy. The pact contains five policy pillars: uniform screening regulations of non-EU arrivals; regular updating of Eurodac, the EU’s fingerprint database for irregular migrant arrivals and beneficiaries of international protection; development of more efficient systems for handling asylum seekers and returnees, and for protecting borders; establishing a solidarity mechanism for more equitable distribution of refugees among member states; and assessing across the bloc preparations for crises and force majeure events. Since June 2022, 23 member states have joined the Voluntary Solidarity Mechanism and pledged to offer financial support or relocation assistance for member states overwhelmed by new arrivals. The EU Asylum Agency was created prior to the pact’s passage to help member states, through training and on-the-ground support, uphold high standards of asylum management. A June 2022 Eurobarometer report found that seven out of 10 respondents in the EU overestimated the number of migrants in their area. The survey also found that 42% of respondents believed that the integration of migrants into their country was “totally successful” while 47% found it to be “totally unsuccessful”.",UNHCR Statistics,https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=2eD6r9,EU Asylum and Migration Pact,https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/new-pact-migration-and-asylum_en,Eurobarometer Report,"https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/what-do-europeans-think-about-migrant-integration-new-eurobarometer-survey-2022-06-20_en#:~:text=Half%20of%20Europeans%20agree%20that,integration%20of%20migrants%20into%20society",,,,,,,"The United States’ 2023 estimated net migration is 3 individuals per 1,000 inhabitants. UNHCR reported 2,195,300 asylum seekers in the country from January to June 2023. Asylum seekers must be physically present in the U.S. to apply for asylum. Asylum benefits and services are administered through the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which oversees job training, English-language classes, medical assistance and financial support for up to 12 months after arrival. The ORR works with individual states to coordinate the Refugee Cash Assistance program, the amount of which varies by location. Migrants may file for permission to work 150 days after submitting a claim for asylum. Work authorization is not granted until at least 180 days after the claim is submitted. After one year in the U.S., asylum seekers may apply for a green card, or permanent residency. In February 2024, the U.S. Senate introduced a bipartisan bill with more stringent requirements for asylum and migration, but it failed to pass despite bipartisan support. The bill would have raised the legal standard to prove a need for asylum and expedited asylum processing so that it is completed within six months. The bill also sought to grant emergency authority to the Department of Homeland Security to close the southern border for up to 45 days if an average of more than 4,000 daily crossings were recorded over a seven-day period.

Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an ever-moving target for Transatlantic Barometer actors, as countries seek to understand both the opportunities and risks posed by emerging technologies. 24 Barometer countries have national AI strategies, with draft strategies, action plans, or executive orders in place for the remaining 6 countries. The European Union is in the final stages of passing its AI Act, which will create a comprehensive legal framework for its member states. Between 2016-2022, 86 AI-related bills have been passed in Barometer countries. Venture capital investment in artificial intelligence also continues to increase, creating a nexus of both innovation and regulation. In the spirit of the topic, the below summary on transatlantic artificial intelligence was written by Chat GPT:\n\nTransatlantic artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration signifies a cooperative venture between North American and European nations to propel the development of AI technology. This initiative spans research, policy, and ethical considerations to create a harmonized approach. By leveraging shared expertise and resources, these regions strive to advance innovation while ensuring responsible AI deployment. The collaboration emphasizes the importance of addressing common challenges, including privacy, security, and biases, through joint research efforts and the establishment of ethical guidelines. Furthermore, the Transatlantic AI community aims to create cohesive regulatory frameworks that promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. Through knowledge exchange, research partnerships, and policy alignment, this collaborative effort seeks to shape a global AI landscape that prioritizes ethical standards, safeguards societal interests, and fosters international cooperation in the realm of artificial intelligence.\n","The European Union (EU) is in the process of ratifying its AI Act, which, if passed, will create binding obligations for all member states. The act was proposed by the European Commission in 2021 and is in final negotiations among member states, the European Parliament, and the European Commission. In December 2023, a provisional agreement was reached. The act uses a risk categorization system based on the level of risk certain applications pose to the safety, health, and rights of individuals. The first is unacceptable risk, which includes AI systems considered a threat, such as biometric identification systems including facial recognition. The second is high risk, which includes AI systems that negatively affect safety or fundamental rights, such as using AI to assist in legal interpretations. The third is generative AI, including Chat GPT, which must comply with transparency requirements. The fourth is limited risk systems that have minimal transparency requirements, to allow users to make informed decisions. An IE University study from October 2023 showed that 68% of Europeans want rules that safeguard jobs from AI advancement, which is 18% higher than the previous year’s study. EU member states in total have passed 57 AI-related bills into law from 2016 to 2022. The EU plans to invest €180 million ($196 million) in breakthrough digital technologies across 28 research projects. Projects selected for funding specialize in advanced AI applications in the European context as well as general AI research in accuracy, security, and accountability.",Stanford University AI Index,https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report-2023_CHAPTER_6-1.pdf,EU Parliament News Article,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence,European Commission Article,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-technologies-and-research,IE University Study,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/11/most-europeans-want-government-restrictions-on-ai-says-study.html,,,,,"The United States does not have a formal national AI strategy. Instead, the U.S. has issued several executive orders on AI, such as “Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence” in 2019 and “Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government” in 2020. The Biden administration in October 2023 issued a wide-ranging executive order entitled “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.” The order includes the creation of new standards for AI safety and security to address chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks. The order also calls for advancing American leadership in AI abroad by working with other nations’ government stakeholders, by attending AI summits and establishing international frameworks for harnessing AI’s benefits and managing its risks. The U.S. enacted 22 AI-related laws between 2016 and 2022. One example is the “AI Training Act,” which requires the Office of Management and Budget to provide an AI training program for government employees who work on program management or logistics in executive agencies.

Youth Unemployment,"Ensuring that young people have viable, long-term career success is a priority for Transatlantic Barometer countries. However, job-seeking youth between 15-24 years old are more likely to be unemployed compared to other age groups. The first step to youth labor market integration is reducing the number of young people not in any kind of education, employment, or training (NEET). The European Union released in 2013 its Youth Guarantee, requiring member states to develop implementation plans to create access to jobs, training, and education for young people that fit the needs of their labor market. The United Kingdom launched its National Youth Guarantee in 2022, with a $679 million investment in youth employment support services. Following a survey to assess the needs and priorities of its young people, Canada released its Youth Policy in 2018. Although it does not have a national youth strategy, the United States has several youth workforce initiatives at the federal level, such as the Registered Apprenticeship and Unlocking Career Success programs. Many of the strategies feature vocational or dual-education pathways, allowing young people to gain the professional skills and training they need without a university degree.","The EU’s average overall unemployment rate in 2023 was 6.1%. The average unemployment rate that year for youths under the age of 25 was 14.2% of the total labor force, while 11.7% of those aged 15 to 29 were not in education, employment or training (NEET). The EU launched in 2013 its Youth Guarantee, a commitment by all member states to ensure that young people can access suitable job, education or training opportunities. The Youth Guarantee was reconceptualized in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to disruptions in education and the labor market that caused NEET levels across the bloc to rise. Between 2013 and 2020, more than 24 million young people previously registered for a Youth Guarantee scheme continued their education or began apprenticeships, traineeships, or other employment. The Youth Guarantee requires each member state to present a Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan and appoint a Youth Guarantee coordinator. The national implementation plans detail initiatives to support youths categorized as NEET by providing skills training or other professional development activities, or employment.

Trade with China,"Transatlantic trade with China has grown rapidly in the last decade, as advancements in manufacturing and e-commerce accessibility continue to grow the global marketplace. In 2021, over $1.68 trillion worth of goods were traded between China and Transatlantic Barometer countries. With this closer economic coupling has come increased political tensions, as transatlantic actors seek to navigate a relationship with China as a partner, competitor, and a rival. The United States imposed tariffs on Chinese products in 2018. In 2022, the European Union filed a WTO complaint against China in response to coercive trade practices against Lithuania. The UK, U.S., and European countries have banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its national 5G network. Canada expelled Chinese diplomats in 2023 following allegations of threats against a Canadian MP. In 2023, China enacted export controls for certain critical raw materials needed for the global semiconductor race, in response to U.S. and EU export controls. Nevertheless, China is ranked as a top five trading partner for the U.S., UK, Canada, and EU with record-high flows of goods, illustrating the complexity of the transatlantic trade relationship with China.","The European Union exported in 2022 $2.71 trillion worth of goods, $252.4 billion, or 9.3%, of which went to China. This also represents 9.3% of China’s imports that year. Cars; electronic tubes and valves; and motor vehicles, parts and accessories were the top three categories of EU exports to China. China was the EU’s third-largest export market in 2022, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. The EU imported $3.16 trillion worth of goods in 2022, $686 billion, or 21.7%, of which came from China. This comprises 19.1% of China’s exports that year. Telecommunications equipment, data processing machines, and electrical machinery and equipment were the top three categories of EU imports from China. The bloc was China’s largest export market in 2022. Negotiations on an EU-China Investment Agreement began in 2013 and concluded, in principle, in 2020, but the agreement has yet to be ratified. The bloc published a European Economic Security Strategy in June 2023, which seeks to promote EU competitiveness, increase supply chain resiliency, minimize threats to technology security, and avoid weaponization of economic dependencies and economic coercion from trade partners. Although the strategy is country-neutral, it was issued amid growing concerns about Chinese trade coercion and EU economic dependence on China as evidenced by imbalances in overall trade and, notably, in strategic goods such as critical raw materials. In July 2023, China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium, two materials needed to create advanced chips for semiconductors. The EU has been investing heavily in its domestic semiconductor industry, with a goal of increasing its global share of production from 9% currently to 20% by 2030.",UN Comtrade,https://comtradeplus.un.org,EU China Trade,https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/china_en,Politico Taiwan Chips,https://www.politico.eu/article/taiwanese-chips-giant-moves-ahead-with-german-plant-investment/,EU Economic Security Strategy,https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_3358,,,,,"The United States exported in 2021 $1.63 trillion worth of goods, $151 billion, or 9.3%, of which went to China. This represents 7.7% of China’s imports that year. Soybeans, integrated circuits, and cars were the top three categories of American exports to China. As the Chinese automotive industry continues to grow, particularly in electric-vehicle production, the United States may see a decline in its share of the Chinese auto market. In 2022, Tesla was the only foreign company among China’s top ten sellers of electric vehicles. The United States imported in 2021 $2.73 trillion worth of goods, $530 billion, or 19.4%, of which came from China. This comprises 15.9% of China’s exports that year. Computers, broadcasting equipment, and office machine parts were the top three American import categories from China. The U.S.-China trade relationship has grown increasingly strained in the last five years. In 2018, the United States enacted tariffs on steel and aluminum, known as Section 232 tariffs, and, following an investigation that concluded China was engaging in unfair trade practices, tariffs on Chinese products, known as Section 301 tariffs. As of July 2023, approximately $250 billion in Chinese imports are subject to a 25% tariff, and another $112 billion are subject to a 7.5% tariff. Section 301 tariffs have impacted the volume of U.S. imports from China, which was down 24% on an annual basis as of May 2023. Mexico has now replaced China as the top country of origin for U.S. imports. In October 2022, the United States also announced export controls to restrict China’s ability to purchase and manufacture advanced chips and semiconductors.

Cybersecurity,"Cybersecurity has played an increasingly important role in the traditional defense sphere, as adversarial state and non-state actors are using digital espionage to obtain sensitive information, paralyze infrastructure, and shut down web-based services from across borders. A NATO release from April 2023 states that hybrid warfare, the combination of attacks by military and non-military cyberattacks, poses a significant challenge to the overall security of the alliance. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many Barometer countries have experienced an increase in cyberattacks, in some instances openly acknowledged by Russian hacking groups as retaliation for support of Ukraine. All Transatlantic Barometer actors have National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) that differ in their goals and implementation, but are united in seeking to create more technologically resilient governments and societies better able to prevent and withstand cyber crises. The European Union also has a Cyber Security Strategy, comprised of legal obligations for its member states through its Network and Information Security 2 Directive, and a roadmap for increased cyber competency across the bloc. Seven Barometer countries (U.S., UK, Estonia, Spain, Lithuania, Canada, and France) are ranked in the top 10 of the United Nations’ Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), demonstrating that cybersecurity is both a priority and a strategic competency for transatlantic actors. ","The European Union developed its first cybersecurity strategy in 2013. The second strategy was launched in 2020, entitled “The EU's Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade.” The strategy was created by the European Commission under the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. It has three main aims: resilience, technological sovereignty and leadership; operational capacity to prevent, deter and respond; and cooperation to advance a global and open cyberspace. The strategy updated the EU’s 2016 Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS), which sought to standardize cyber-resilience across EU member states. The EU’s NIS2 Directive concentrates on cyber crisis management and reporting procedures across the bloc, and requires member states to have a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), as well as a designated NIS authority. All member states must be compliant with NIS2 by October 2024. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) cooperates with member states to strengthen their cybersecurity capabilities by providing research and sharing best practices. The strategy also proposed the creation of a Joint Cyber Unit, a platform for coordination among EU institutions and agencies, member states, and law enforcement. In November 2022, external access to the European Parliament’s website was briefly cut off after being subject to a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, shortly after a Parliament vote declaring Russia a state sponsor of terrorism in its war against Ukraine.

It was updated again in 2023. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the National Security Council are responsible for implementing the strategy. The United States’ NCSS lists five objectives: defend critical infrastructure; disrupt and dismantle threat actors; shape market forces to drive security and resilience; invest in a resilient future; and forge international partnerships. The UN’s International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) measures national cybersecurity commitments across legal, technical, organizational, capacity building, and cooperative indicators. The GCI ranks the United States 1st out of 194 countries with a score of 100.00 out of 100. The United States’ score is due in part to its collaborative approach to cybersecurity, both inside and outside its borders, as well as investment in developing cyber technologies. In May 2023, Microsoft issued a warning that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group had compromised critical infrastructure in the U.S., including in the communications, manufacturing, utility and transportation sectors, causing the U.S. government to issue a warning.

Women in Government,"In both North America and Europe, women are running for political office at unprecedented rates, resulting in increased representation of women at the federal legislative level. In addition to greater advocacy and legislation on priority issues for women, research from the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership links higher rates of women in government to lower corruption levels; increased engagement with constituents; and prioritization of education, health and welfare issues. This means that more women in government is not just beneficial to women, but to all constituents. To increase the number of female parliamentarians and ministers, a number of European countries have established mandatory gender quotas for party candidate lists and/or representative bodies, and many political parties have implemented additional voluntary quotas within their own party ranks. Gender mainstreaming, or the practice of integrating a gender equality perspective at all levels of policy and programming, has become a pillar of transatlantic gender policy both domestically and abroad, as evidenced by the “feminist foreign policy” strategies of France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada. Despite this, there are still a number of barriers to women seeking elected office, including: insufficient recruitment, campaign financing, gender bias, family responsibilities, and a lack of gender-sensitive workplace policies.","In the EU’s 27 member states, an average 33% of national parliamentarians are women, as are 33.4% of ministers. Following Brexit in 2021, 39.5% of parliamentarians in the European Parliament are women, as are 48% of EU Commissioners. There are no EU-level gender quotas. It is, rather, up to member-state governments and political parties to enact mandatory or voluntary quotas. The 2022 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index, using economic, educational, health and political indicators, ranks four EU member states in the top 10 of 146 countries for gender parity: Finland (2nd), Sweden (5th), Ireland (9th) and Germany (10th). Three EU member states also rank in the top 10 for political empowerment: Finland (2nd), Germany (8th), and Sweden (10th). The political empowerment ranking is based on the percentage of women in parliament, the percentage of women in ministerial positions and the number of years with a female head of state or government. Research from the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership links higher rates of women in government with lower corruption levels; increased engagement with constituents; prioritization of education, health and welfare issues; and greater legislation on priority issues for women. The European Union has a Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 that includes a section on achieving gender balance in decision-making and politics. In it, the European Commission pledges to promote through funding and best practices the participation of women as voters and candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections.

The 2022 World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index, using economic, educational, health and political indicators, ranks the United States 27th of 146 countries for gender parity. The country’s political empowerment score is 38th overall based on the percentage of women in the Congress, the percentage of women in ministerial positions and the number of years with a female head of state or government. The United States has never had a female president. Research from the Global Institute for Women’s Leadership links higher rates of women in government with lower corruption levels; increased engagement with constituents; prioritization of education, health and welfare issues; and greater legislation on priority issues for women. The United States released in 2021 its first National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, which includes a section on democracy, representation and leadership. The strategy identifies the need to advance gender diversity in all government sectors, but fails to include specific target goals. A 2021 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences entitled “Pragmatic bias impedes women’s access to political leadership,” found that only 18% of respondents believed most Americans were “very or extremely ready” for a female president.",World Economic Forum Global Gender Report,https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2022.pdf,GIWL Women Political Leaders Report,https://www.kcl.ac.uk/giwl/assets/women-political-leaders.pdf,National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality Fact Sheet,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/,Congress Needs Gender Parity Quotas,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/22/fact-sheet-national-strategy-on-gender-equity-and-equality/,Congress has a record number of women,https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2023/01/03/118th-congress-has-a-record-number-of-women/,Pragmatic bias impedes women’s access to political leadership,https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2112616119#sec-1,"Female Representation in Government ",barChart,,,,,,,
Broadband and Digital Connectivity,"Access to high-speed broadband is a policy priority for transatlantic actors. The European Union boasts a Digital Decade program, the United States has a Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, and the United Kingdom maintains its Project Gigabit. All three efforts focus on increasing broadband access and overall digital connectivity for residents. \nDigital connectivity topped the agenda at the December 2022 U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting. Increased digital connectivity expands economic and educational opportunities for those hindered by geography, socioeconomic status, or disability. High-speed broadband access is essential for navigating an increasingly digital world, especially one in which remote work and online education are growing more prevalent.\nNot all broadband is created equal, however. Next generation access (NGA), or broadband that operates at speeds of at least 30 megabits per second (Mbps), is considered the entry point to high-speed internet. The EU aims for internet access with a speed of 1000 Mbps, or 1 gigabit per second (Gbps), for all its residents by 2030. Although this gigabit internet is much faster than that currently in most households, the potential economic and educational advancement that comes with high-speed broadband has spurred the EU to think ahead. Gigabit internet operates through very high capacity networks (VHCNs) and relies on an infrastructure largely comprised of fiber optic cables and, to a lesser extent, coaxial cables. Both are lighter, stronger, and more stable than traditional copper cables. Continuing investment in VHCN infrastructure, driven by fiber optic cable deployment, will shape the future of transatlantic digital connectivity.","Based on the average of its 27 member states, 78% of EU households have fixed broadband subscriptions. Next generation access (NGA) broadband, or fast broadband with speeds of at least 30 megabits per second (Mbps), reaches 90% of households. The EU’s Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) rates the average affordability of broadband across the bloc at 73/100 (with “100” being the least expensive). EU-wide very high capacity network (VHCN) coverage stands at 70%, a sharp uptick from 19.5% coverage in 2014. Fiber to the premises (FTTP) coverage is at 50%, double the level in 2016. Expanding access to high-speed internet infrastructure is critical to achieving the goals of the EU’s Digital Decade, a wide-ranging policy program meant to transform by 2030 the bloc’s digital capacity for skills training, infrastructure, online public services, and business transformation. The EU specifically aims to achieve universal gigabit internet coverage by 2030, but the biggest impediment to this is the urban-rural digital divide, especially in high-speed infrastructure, across the bloc. While overall VHCN coverage is 70%, it is just 37% in rural areas; overall FTTP coverage is 50%, but 33.7% in rural areas. The DESI report has identified three major goals for closing the digital divide: creating a predictable regulatory environment, providing incentives for private investment in underserviced areas, and prioritizing mechanisms to minimize deployment costs. To achieve these aims, the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility will allocate more than €16 billion in funding for digital connectivity initiatives. The plans of 21 member states include specific connectivity aims, primarily focused on improving rural high-speed broadband infrastructure. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF Digital) has also allocated €2 billion through 2027 for high-performance connectivity projects in line with the Digital Decade objectives.",Digital Economy and Society Index,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi-2022,Broadband Connectivity in the Digital Economy and Society Index,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi-connectivity,Europe’s Digital Decade Policy,https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en,Broadband Glossary,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/broadband-glossary,Connecting Europe Facility,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/cef-digital,,,"The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 87% of American households have fixed broadband subscriptions. Most national broadband indicators identify only the percentage of residents with broadband access, not broadband take-up or speed. Internet access is hindered by high subscription costs, disparities in urban-rural coverage and availability of high-speed infrastructure. In an effort to address these challenges, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocates €60.8 billion ($65 billion) for broadband expansion. But the Biden administration’s overarching Internet for All broadband strategy comprises seven major initiatives, including the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program and the Affordable Connectivity Fund, the latter of which focuses on rural, tribal and low-income communities. The BEAD Program is the flagship effort of the Internet for All strategy, and reflects the administration’s priority to bridge the urban-rural digital divide. State governments must outline a budget and action plan to receive BEAD Program funds. There is minimal federal coordination. In contrast to the EU’s Digital Decade agenda, which strives for universal gigabit coverage by 2030, current U.S. broadband policy does not set specific goals for internet speeds or infrastructure project completion dates.",New America Cost Connectivity Report,"https://www.newamerica.org/oti/reports/cost-connectivity-2020/global-findings/#:~:text=The%20average%20monthly%20price%20for,advertise%20DSL%20or%20cable%20plans",White House Building a Better America Report,https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA-V2.pdf#page=385,White House Broadband Fact Sheet,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-reduce-high-speed-internet-costs-for-millions-of-americans/,Pew Research Broadband Report,https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/06/13/mobile-technology-and-home-broadband-2019/,,,,,Next Generation Access Coverage,barChart,,,,,,,
Renewable Energy & Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union as well as its member states have each pledged to play a key role in leading climate action at both the national and multilateral levels. All 27 EU member states are party to the European Climate Law enacted in July 2021, which requires climate neutrality by 2050 and sets an emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 as compared to 1990 levels. In February 2021, the United States formally rejoined the Paris Agreement after withdrawing from the accords in 2017. In August 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which targets a 40% emissions decrease compared to 2005 levels by 2030, as well as investments in renewable energy technology. The UK enacted the Climate Change Act in 2008, which aims to reduce greenhouse emissions by 100% of 1990 levels by 2050. Following the Conference of Parties (COP) 27 in November 2022, the transatlantic community, along with other major global emitters, signed an agreement to compensate developing countries for climate loss and damage, although the text did not include commitments to reducing fossil fuel usage.  The Transatlantic Barometer examines renewable energy percentages and level of greenhouse gas emissions per capita from 2004 through 2020 for 30 transatlantic actors, as well as national-level climate and energy initiatives.","Based on the average of its 27 member states, the European Union has steadily increased its use of renewable energy as a share of total energy consumption, while greenhouse gas emissions per capita have decreased. Renewable sources accounted for 9.6% of the bloc’s total energy use in 2004, 16.0% in 2012, and 22.09% in 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita were 10.7 thousand kilograms in 2004, 9.3 in 2012, and 7.5 in 2020, accounting for stable population growth. Historically, hydropower has long been the main source of renewable energy for the EU, but wind power has recently surpassed it. In addition to wind, solar power generation has also been growing, a reflection of member state initiatives to increase production in these sectors. The European Union has introduced a number of legislative initiatives to curb climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Through its European Green Deal, the EU pursues its goal of making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050. The European Climate Law sets a binding target of 55% emissions reduction (compared to 1990 levels) across the bloc by 2030, requiring member states to submit National Energy and Climate Plans to create national frameworks to achieve EU goals. The EU’s Emissions Trading System, a cornerstone of its emissions reduction policies, created a “cap-and-trade” system, which sets an upper limit on the amount of emissions industries can produce, while allowing emitters to buy additional capacity from lower-producing companies that have not hit their limits. This system has set the stage for the EU to meet collective targets as a whole even as it accommodates member states’ unique national needs. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted the EU to move faster to end its reliance on Russian gas and to create the REpowerEU initiative, a set of policies designed to save energy, increase clean energy production, and diversify energy supply throughout the bloc.","REPowerEU: affordable, secure and sustainable energy for Europe",https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en,A European Green Deal,https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en,EU Emissions Trading System,https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets_en#a-cap-and-trade-system,Eurostat - Greenhouse gas emissions per capita,https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/t2020_rd300/default/bar?lang=en,Eurostat - SHARES (Renewables),https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/shares,European Climate Law,https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/european-green-deal/european-climate-law_en,"The United States has gradually increased its use of renewable energy as a percentage of total energy consumption since 2004.

Renewable sources accounted for 6.08% of the United States’ total energy use in 2004, 8.86% in 2012, and 12.16% in 2020. The United States’ greenhouse gas emissions per capita were 25.4 thousand kilograms in 2004, 21.1 in 2012, and 18.2 in 2020, accounting for a growth in population. The United States’ renewable energy largely comes from wind, hydroelectric, and biomass sources. In 2022, the Department of Energy announced that $10 million from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also known as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will be used to jump-start solar energy careers in underserved communities.

Media Freedom,"According to the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), media freedom, along with media plurality and access to government information, are three indicators for assessing information access in a democracy. Media freedom, in particular, is a core pillar of any liberal democracy, and one that, amid global democratic backsliding, is becoming increasingly important. To what extent are media outlets independent of government control? Are there bodies and laws that help ensure media outlets retain independence while meeting standards for quality, diversity, and fairness? This topic covers the state of media freedom within the transatlantic community. According to the SGI scale for media freedom, a score of 10.0 to 9.0 means that “public and private media are independent from government influence; their independence is institutionally protected and fully respected by the incumbent government”; A score of 8.0 to 6.0 means that “the incumbent government largely respects the independence of media. However, there are occasional attempts to exert influence”; a score of 5.0 to 3.0 means that “the incumbent government seeks to secure its political objectives indirectly through influencing the personnel policies, organizational structure, or financial resources of public media, and/or through the licensing regime/market access for private media”; and a score of 2.0 to 1.0 means that “major media outlets are frequently influenced by the incumbent government’s efforts to promote partisan political objectives. To ensure pro-government coverage, governmental actors exert direct political pressure on media outlets. These actors also violate existing media regulation, or amend it, to benefit government interests.""","
The EU is not featured in the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s SGI report. However, the EU undertakes comprehensive efforts to secure media freedom, and these are important to the Transatlantic Barometer. Freedom of expression, media freedom, and media pluralism are all protected under the EU Charter for Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Parliament (EP) has taken its own measures in recent years to promote media freedom in the EU and beyond. The EP called in November 2021 for new rules to protect journalists from censorship and, in March 2022, a special parliamentary committee adopted a report that urged European authorities to support independent media and devise a common strategy to counter foreign influence and disinformation. In May 2022, the EP also established a scholarship for young journalists. The award bears the name of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered in 2017 for her work.

Media independence suffered under the administration of former President Donald Trump, whose claims of “fake news” eroded public support for the media, primarily among his supporters. The claims also led to increased violence against journalists. A 2019 Freedom House report details the former president’s threats to strengthen libel laws, revoke the licenses of certain broadcasters, and damage media owners’ business interests.

Voting and Registration Rights,"According to the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), voting and registration rights, candidacy procedures, media access, party financing, and popular decision-making are all indicators for assessing democratic electoral processes. The right to vote, in particular, is a basic tenet of a liberal democracy. Nations of the transatlantic community, a bloc founded upon core democratic values, offer various ways for citizens to register to vote and, ultimately, cast a ballot. This topic showcases how individual transatlantic actors perform. According to the SGI scale for voting and registration rights, a score of 10.0 to 9.0 means that “all adult citizens can participate in national elections. All eligible voters are registered if they wish to be. No discrimination in exercising one’s right to vote is observed. No disincentives to voting exist”; a score of 8.0 to 6.0 means that “procedures for voter registration and voting are generally effective, impartial, and nondiscriminatory. Citizens who believe that they were discriminated against during the voting process can appeal to courts. Disincentives to voting generally do not constitute genuine obstacles; a score of 5.0 to 3.0 means that “procedures for voter registration and voting are de jure nondiscriminatory, but isolated cases of discrimination occur in practice. Disincentives to voting constitute significant obstacles for some citizens”; and a score of 2.0 to 1.0 means that “procedures for voter registration or voting are systemically discriminatory. A substantial number of adult citizens are excluded from national elections.""","The EU is not featured in the Bertelsmann Stiftung’s SGI report. However, the EU’s voting and registration laws are important to the Transatlantic Barometer. The process by which EU citizens register to vote is determined country by country. EU law gives citizens of the bloc residing in another member state the right to participate in European Parliament elections that occur every five years. Czech, Greek, Irish, Maltese, and Slovak citizens may vote for a European Parliament candidate representing their country of residence. They may not, however, vote from abroad for a candidate to represent their home country. They must return to their country of origin and vote in person if they prefer to do that.

Disincentives to voting constitute significant obstacles for some citizens.” American citizens aged 18 and older may vote. Voter registration is complex and the subject of nationwide debate. The 50 individual states, the District of Columbia, and overseas territories are responsible for overseeing elections but remain subject to federal regulation. Noncitizens may not vote, but they are strongly encouraged to take the path to citizenship. Many states expanded mail-in voting for the 2020 U.S. general elections to circumvent pandemic-related dangers of in-person voting. This may have led to an exceedingly high turnout rate of 70.8%. Since the election, former President Donald Trump has erroneously claimed voter fraud from mail-in ballots. States governed by the Republican party have consequently introduced legislation restricting voting rights. Critics argue the legislation is aimed at low-income and minority communities. States governed by Democrats have enacted expansive voting rights legislation, and the Biden administration has attempted to follow suit on the federal level. These efforts have failed, however, owing to the Democrats’ slim majority in the U.S. Senate.
