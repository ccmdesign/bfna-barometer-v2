# Implementation Summary: "View Archived Topics" Bug Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** ✅ Implemented

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Issue 3: Country Page - Archived Topics Filter (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File:** [pages/region/[slug].vue](../../pages/region/[slug].vue)

**Changes:**
- Added `refresh` and `pending` exports from `useAsyncData`
- Made `handleArchivedTopics()` async and added explicit `await refreshTopics()` call
- Updated `onMounted` to check if topics are loaded before calling `handleActiveTopic()`
- Added `watch` on `topics` to initialize `activeTopic` when data loads
- Added `:disabled="pending"` to "View Archived Topics" button for loading state

**Why this fixes the issue:**
- Explicitly refreshing the data ensures the query re-runs when toggling archived state
- Checking for loaded data prevents race conditions on mount
- Watcher ensures `handleActiveTopic()` runs when data is available
- Disabled state prevents rapid clicking during data fetch

### 2. Fixed Issue 1: Home Page - Initial Click Failure (HIGH PRIORITY)

**File:** [pages/index.vue](../../pages/index.vue)

**Changes:**
- Changed `filters` from `ref({})` to `reactive({ archived: false, tag: null, sort: 'DESC' })`
- Updated `useAsyncData` watch option to watch individual filter properties:
  ```javascript
  watch: [
    () => filters.archived,
    () => filters.tag,
    () => filters.sort
  ]
  ```
- Updated all `filters.value.X` references to `filters.X`
- Made `handleFilters()` async and added explicit `await refreshTopics()` call
- Added `refresh` and `pending` exports from `useAsyncData`
- Passed `:loading="pending"` prop to `barTopicsSection`

**Why this fixes the issue:**
- Reactive object with initialized values ensures proper change detection
- Watching individual properties (not the object itself) ensures Vue reactivity triggers
- Explicit refresh ensures data refetches on filter changes
- Initial values prevent undefined → value transitions that Vue might not detect

### 3. Fixed Issue 2: Navigation State Pollution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**File:** [components/ds/ccmTabs.vue](../../components/ds/ccmTabs.vue)

**Changes:**
- Added `onUnmounted` lifecycle hook to clean up `activeTab` query parameter:
  ```javascript
  onUnmounted(() => {
    const { activeTab, ...rest } = route.query
    if (activeTab !== undefined) {
      router.replace({ query: rest })
    }
  })
  ```

**Why this fixes the issue:**
- Removes the `activeTab` query parameter when navigating away from home page
- Prevents query parameter pollution across different pages
- Ensures clean URL state when navigating to country pages

### 4. Added Loading States (UX IMPROVEMENT)

**File:** [components/barTopicsSection.vue](../../components/barTopicsSection.vue)

**Changes:**
- Added `loading` prop to component props
- Added `:disabled="loading"` to all filter controls:
  - Category select dropdown
  - Sort button
  - View Archived Topics button

**Why this improves UX:**
- Prevents users from clicking filters while data is loading
- Provides visual feedback that the system is working
- Prevents race conditions from rapid clicking
- Makes the loading state obvious to users

## Files Modified

1. `pages/index.vue` - Fixed reactive watching + added loading states
2. `pages/region/[slug].vue` - Fixed race conditions + added explicit refresh
3. `components/barTopicsSection.vue` - Added loading prop and disabled states
4. `components/ds/ccmTabs.vue` - Added cleanup on unmount

## Testing Checklist

Test the following scenarios to verify fixes:

### Issue 3 (Country Page):
- [ ] Direct navigation to country page → click "View Archived Topics" immediately
- [ ] Toggle archived filter multiple times rapidly
- [ ] Verify topics list changes when toggling archived
- [ ] Verify button is disabled during loading
- [ ] Verify no console errors when toggling

### Issue 1 (Home Page):
- [ ] Load home page → immediately click "View Archived Topics"
- [ ] Verify topics change on first click (no need to reload)
- [ ] Toggle archived filter multiple times rapidly
- [ ] Change category filter and verify it works
- [ ] Change sort order and verify it works
- [ ] Combine filters (archived + category + sort) and verify all work together
- [ ] Verify buttons are disabled during loading

### Issue 2 (Navigation):
- [ ] Home page → switch to Topics tab
- [ ] Switch to Countries tab
- [ ] Click on a country
- [ ] Verify page layout is correct (not broken)
- [ ] Check URL - verify no `?activeTab=X` in country page URL
- [ ] Use browser back button to return to home
- [ ] Verify tabs state is preserved correctly

### General:
- [ ] Test with browser refresh (Ctrl+R) on each page
- [ ] Test with browser back/forward buttons
- [ ] Verify no console errors or warnings
- [ ] Check performance - filters should feel responsive

## Technical Notes

### Why `reactive()` instead of `ref()`?

Using `reactive()` with individual property watchers is more reliable than watching a `ref()` object because:
- Vue's reactivity system tracks individual property changes in reactive objects
- Watching `ref({})` only triggers when the entire object reference changes
- Watching `() => filters.property` triggers on that specific property change

### Why explicit `refresh()` calls?

While `useAsyncData` with `watch` should auto-refresh, explicitly calling `refresh()`:
- Guarantees the query runs when we want it to
- Makes the code more predictable and easier to debug
- Provides a clear async boundary for UI feedback (loading states)
- Works around potential Nuxt SPA-mode timing issues

### Why `onUnmounted` cleanup?

In Nuxt SPA mode:
- Query parameters persist across route changes
- The `activeTab` param is only relevant on the home page
- Cleaning it up on unmount prevents layout issues on other pages
- This is cleaner than checking route paths in multiple places

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing:** Follow the testing checklist above
2. **User Testing:** Have the original bug reporter test the fixes
3. **Monitor:** Watch for any new issues or regressions
4. **Consider:** The recommendations in the analysis doc:
   - Enable SSR for better performance
   - Add error handling for failed data fetches
   - Consider Pinia stores for shared state management
